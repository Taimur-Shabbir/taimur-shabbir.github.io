Hi. My name is Taimur and as you can see from this website, I love exploring data and the way it can be used to improved business outcomes.

That can mean using machine learning techniques to cluster customers together so that we can find out the traits of those customers specifically that respond well to certain marketing campaigns. Or it can mean using customer data to predict which customers will churn.

I also leverage data in my personal life; I can tell you the exact amount of reps I did for a specific exercise I did for every workout in the past 1.5 years and how that influenced the workout I planned to do in the subsequent week. Ditto for sleep and nutrition tracking.

My data journey has involved quite an eclectic mix of industries. I have experience in the consumer goods (at Coca Cola European Partners) and healthcare/manufacturing industries, while I am currently part of the Data Insights team at Chip, a fintech whose mission is to build wealth for our customers.

Before I got into data, my intention was to join a management consulting firm. To that end, I also have non-data oriented experience in consulting and financial services through various internships, across the United Kingdom (London), United Arab Emirates (Dubai) and Pakistan

Outside of work, my interests include hypertrophy training, reading (sci-fi, fantasy and horror + non-fiction), cycling and fighting video games (I'm a Ken player in Street Fighter 6 and Johnny Cage veteran in Mortal Kombat). I also consider myself somewhat of a film connoisseur.

Please feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out with any questions or comments.
