Hi. My name is Taimur and as you can see from this website, I love exploring data and the way it can be used to improved business outcomes.

That can mean using machine learning techniques to cluster customers together so that we can find out the traits of those customers specifically that respond well to certain marketing campaigns. Or it can mean using customer data to predict which customers will churn.

I also leverage data in my personal life; I can tell you the exact amount of reps I did for a specific exercise I did for every workout in the past 1.5 years and how that influenced the workout I planned to do in the subsequent week. Ditto for sleep and nutrition tracking.

My data analyst experience is in the consumer goods (at Coca Cola European Partners) and healthcare/manufacturing industries, although I am more interested in customer-centric and marketing analytics ([you can read my thoughts regarding this at my blog](https://medium.com/@alitaimurshabbir)). I also have non-data oriented experience in consulting and financial services through various internships, across the United Kingdom (London), United Arab Emirates (Dubai) and Pakistan

Outside of work, my interests include training, reading (sci-fi, fantasy and horror + non-fiction), cycling and video games. I also consider myself somewhat of a film connoisseur.

I'm based in London and actively looking for data roles here so please feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out with any questions or comments.
