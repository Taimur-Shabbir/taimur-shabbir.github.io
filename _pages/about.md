Hi. My name is Taimur and as you can see from this website, I am a bit obsessive about data and the way it can be used to improved outcomes, whether that is in a professional context (business objectives and KPIs) or a personal one.

That can mean using machine learning techniques to find and group customers in clusters by shared characteristics so that we can find out the traits of those customers specifically that respond well to certain marketing campaigns.

Or it can mean that I can tell you the exact amount of reps I did for a specific exercise I did for every workout in the past 1.5 years and how that changed the workout I planned to do in the subsequent week. Ditto for sleep and nutrition tracking.

My data analyst experience in the consumer goods (at Coca Cola European Partners) and healthcare/manufacturing industries, although I am more interested in customer-centric and marketing analytics ([you can read my thoughts regarding this at my blog](https://medium.com/@alitaimurshabbir)). I also have non-data oriented experience in consulting and financial services through various internships, across the United Kingdom (London), United Arab Emirates (Dubai) and Pakistan

I'm actively looking for data roles in Berlin so please feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out with any questions or comments.
